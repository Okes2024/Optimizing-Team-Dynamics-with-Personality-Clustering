# Optimizing Team Dynamics with Personality Clustering

This project forms diverse teams using personality trait clustering. It:
1. Generates synthetic personality data (Big Five traits)
2. Clusters individuals using K-Means
3. Forms teams ensuring diverse cluster representation
4. Compares against random team formation

## Results
- **Cluster-based teams**: Higher average diversity
- **Random teams**: Lower diversity (baseline comparison)

## Usage
1. Install requirements:
```bash
pip install numpy scikit-learn
